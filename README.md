# sleep-tracker
Two iPhone shortcuts (from the Shortcuts app) to track the time you spend sleeping and update your Health app accordingly.

To use them, download the Shortcuts app, navigate to the files on your phone, go to the links, and save them to your Shortcuts app. You can use them by opening the Shortcuts app and touching their icons, setting up a [widget](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/run-shortcuts-from-the-home-screen-widget-apd029b36d05/ios) or [pseudo-app](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/add-a-shortcut-to-the-home-screen-apd735880972/ios). You also can run the shortcuts [through Siri](https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT209055#:~:text=Run%20a%20shortcut,and%20Apple%20Watch.). Note you may need to run the shortcuts manually in the Shortcuts app once before being able to run them through Siri, and it may be easier to remove the "- Share" from the shortcuts' name to run them through Siri (that way you won't have to say "share" when saying their names to run them through Siri).
